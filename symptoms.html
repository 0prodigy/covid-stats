          <h1>What are the symptoms of COVID 19</h1>
          <p>
            The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and
            tiredness. Other symptoms that are less common and may affect some
            patients include aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache,
            conjunctivitis, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of taste or smell or a
            rash on skin or discoloration of fingers or toes. These symptoms are
            usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but
            only have very mild symptoms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing
            hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19
            becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older
            people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood
            pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer, are at
            higher risk of developing serious illness. However, anyone can catch
            COVID-19 and become seriously ill. People of all ages who experience
            fever and/or cough associated withdifficulty breathing/shortness of
            breath, chest pain/pressure, or loss of speech or movement should
            seek medical attention immediately. If possible, it is recommended
            to call the health care provider or facility first, so the patient
            can be directed to the right clinic.
